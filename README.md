# Tidy Text

An extension for [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/) to allow
toggling the visibility of image labels.

![Interface Demo](./docs/demo.gif)

## Usage

With the tool selected, clicking on an object (prop, character, etc.)
either hides an existing label or restores a hidden label.

Adding new text (in the usual manner) will overwrite any hidden text.

The extension also includes "hide all" and "show all" buttons that can be
used while the tool is active.
