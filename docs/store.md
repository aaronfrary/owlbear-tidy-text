# Tidy Text

A lightweight tool to quickly toggle the visibility of image labels.

## Usage

With the tool selected, clicking on an object (prop, character, etc.)
either hides an existing label or restores a hidden label.

The extension also includes "hide all" and "show all" buttons that can be
used while the tool is active.

If new text is added to an object that already has hidden text, the texts
are concatenated on hide/show to avoid losing any data.
